# XEMM Rust - Cross-Exchange Market Making Bot on Pacifica (Maker) and Hyperliquid (Taker)

A high-performance Rust trading bot that performs arbitrage between Pacifica (maker) and Hyperliquid (taker). The bot continuously monitors orderbook feeds from both exchanges, places limit orders on Pacifica when profitable opportunities arise, and immediately hedges fills on Hyperliquid.
The main rationale is to use Hyperliquid's better liquidity, namely lower spreads, to do arbitrage trades on Pacifica immediately hedged on Hyperliquid.

## Architecture Overview

The diagram below illustrates the bot’s trading idea. We arbitrage the fact that the bid–ask spread is often tighter on Hyperliquid than on Pacifica because Hyperliquid has better liquidity. This is better than classical taker-to-taker arbitrage because:
* there are more such opportunities
* in taker-to-taker arbitrage, it is very hard or even impossible to compete on latency with professionals and exchanges
* you are arbitraging your own limit order price, so you may have a latency advantage

Run on *AWS Tokyo* to have the best latency.

Here, `profit_rate_bps` is actually a safety margin on top of a theoretically profitable maker-taker trade, to compensate for fees, slippage and latency.

This bot is Inspired by Hummingbot's XEMM Strategy.

## Features

### Core Trading
- ✅ **Real-time Arbitrage Detection** - Monitors both exchanges simultaneously
- ✅ **Automatic Order Placement** - Places limit orders on Pacifica when profitable
- ✅ **Instant Hedging** - Executes market orders on Hyperliquid after fills
- ✅ **Profit Monitoring** - Tracks and cancels orders if profit deviates
- ✅ **Order Refresh** - Auto-cancels stale orders based on age
- ✅ **Single-cycle Mode** - Exits after one successful arbitrage cycle

### Fill Detection (5 Layers)

The bot uses a multi-layered fill detection system for maximum reliability:

1. **WebSocket Fill Detection** (primary, real-time) - Monitors Pacifica's `account_order_updates` channel
2. **WebSocket Position Detection** (redundancy, real-time) - Monitors Pacifica's `account_positions` channel for position deltas
3. **REST API Order Polling** (backup, 500ms) - Polls order status via REST API
4. **Position Monitor** (ground truth, 500ms) - Detects fills by monitoring position changes via REST
5. **Monitor Safety Check** (defensive) - Pre-cancellation verification in monitoring task

All methods deduplicate via shared HashSet to ensure only one hedge executes per fill.

### Exchange Connectivity

**Pacifica:**
- WebSocket orderbook (real-time bid/ask feed)
- WebSocket fill detection (monitors order fills/cancellations via `account_order_updates`)
- WebSocket position monitoring (detects fills from position changes via `account_positions`)
- WebSocket trading (ultra-fast order cancellation, no rate limits)
- REST API trading (authenticated order placement/cancellation)
- REST API polling (fallback orderbook data)
- REST API positions (position monitoring for fill detection)
- Ed25519 authenticated operations (both WebSocket and REST)
- **Dual cancellation safety** - Uses both REST + WebSocket for redundancy
- **Cross-validation** - Position-based detection validates order-based detection

**Hyperliquid:**
- WebSocket orderbook (real-time L2 book)
- REST API positions (clearinghouse state for position verification)
- EIP-712 authenticated trading (market orders)
- Automatic slippage protection
- **WebSocket trading for hedges (default)** – Hedge market orders are sent as signed `post` actions over the Hyperliquid WebSocket for minimal latency, with REST fallback on error.

### Hedge Execution Architecture

This development branch introduces a low-latency, queue-based hedge pipeline and WebSocket-based Hyperliquid execution:

- **Hedge event queue (non-blocking)**  
  - All fill-detection layers (`FillDetectionService`, `RestFillDetectionService`, `PositionMonitorService`) act as **producers** and push `HedgeEvent`s into an unbounded Tokio `mpsc` channel.  
  - Producers never block when enqueuing, so fill detection is not slowed down by hedge execution.

- **Dedicated hedge executor task**  
  - `HedgeService` runs in its own async task and acts as a **single consumer** of the hedge event queue.  
  - It awaits `hedge_rx.recv().await`, so as soon as an event arrives, the hedge flow starts; there is no polling interval.

- **WebSocket-first Hyperliquid hedging**  
  - On startup, `HedgeService` establishes a dedicated Hyperliquid trading WebSocket connection and keeps it alive for hedging.  
  - Hedge orders are built and signed once (shared logic), then wrapped in a WS `post` request (`type: "action"`) and sent over the hot WebSocket.
  - WS responses are parsed into the same `OrderResponse` type as REST, so the downstream profit and verification logic is unchanged.
  - If WS execution fails for a given hedge (connection error or WS-level error), the bot **falls back to REST** for that hedge and logs the reason.

- **Config toggle: WS vs REST**  
  - `Config.hyperliquid_use_ws_for_hedge` (default: `true`) controls the execution path:  
    - `true` → use WebSocket for hedging, with REST fallback on error.  
    - `false` → use REST-only hedging (original behavior).

### Performance & Reliability
- ✅ **Multi-source Orderbook** - WebSocket primary, REST API fallback
- ✅ **Dual Cancellation** - REST + WebSocket cancellation on fill (defense in depth)
- ✅ **Auto-reconnect** - Exponential backoff on connection failures
- ✅ **Concurrent Tasks** - 10 async tasks running in parallel
- ✅ **High-frequency Monitoring** - 25ms profit checks, 100ms opportunity evaluation
- ✅ **Zero Rate Limits** - WebSocket cancellation bypasses API rate limits
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown** - Cancels orders on Ctrl+C

### User Interface
- ✅ **Colorized Terminal Output** - Easy-to-read colored logs with section labels
- ✅ **Visual Status Indicators** - Green ✓ for success, Red ✗ for errors, Yellow ⚠ for warnings
- ✅ **Real-time Profit Display** - Color-coded profit changes (green = increasing, red = decreasing)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Trade Summary** - Beautiful formatted summary with emojis and colors on completion

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up credentials

Create a `.env` file with your API credentials:

```bash
# Pacifica credentials
PACIFICA_API_KEY=your_api_key
PACIFICA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_base58
PACIFICA_ACCOUNT=your_account_address

# Hyperliquid credentials
HL_WALLET=your_wallet_address
HL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_hex
```

### 2. Configure bot parameters

Edit `config.json`:

```json
{
  "symbol": "SOL",
  "reconnect_attempts": 5,
  "ping_interval_secs": 15,
  "pacifica_maker_fee_bps": 1.5,
  "hyperliquid_taker_fee_bps": 4.0,
  "profit_rate_bps": 15.0,
  "order_notional_usd": 20.0,
  "profit_cancel_threshold_bps": 3.0,
  "order_refresh_interval_secs": 60,
  "hyperliquid_slippage": 0.05,
  "pacifica_rest_poll_interval_secs": 2
}
```

### 3. Run the bot

```bash
# Run the XEMM trading bot. Warning: This will perform only one cycle (one maker order filled on Pacifica and then hedged ASAP on Hyperliquid). Use `run_bot_loop_cargo.sh` to run cycles continuously.
cargo run

# With debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run

# In release mode (optimized, full performance)
cargo run --release
```

### Bot State Machine

The bot uses a state machine to track lifecycle:

- **Idle** - Waiting for opportunity, no active order
- **OrderPlaced** - Order placed on Pacifica, monitoring for fill
- **Filled** - Order filled, waiting for hedge execution
- **Hedging** - Hedge being executed on Hyperliquid
- **Complete** - Cycle complete, bot exits
- **Error** - Unrecoverable error occurred

### Concurrent Tasks

The XEMM bot orchestrates 10 async tasks running in parallel:

1. **Pacifica Orderbook (WebSocket)** - Real-time bid/ask feed
2. **Hyperliquid Orderbook (WebSocket)** - Real-time bid/ask feed
3. **Fill Detection (WebSocket)** - Monitors Pacifica order fills/cancellations (primary + position delta)
4. **Pacifica REST API Polling** - Fallback orderbook data (every 2s)
5. **Hyperliquid REST API Polling** - Fallback orderbook data (every 2s)
6. **REST API Fill Detection** - Backup fill polling (every 500ms)
7. **Position Monitor** - Position-based fill detection (every 500ms, ground truth)
8. **Order Monitoring** - Profit tracking and order refresh (every 25ms)
9. **Hedge Execution** - Executes Hyperliquid hedge after fill
10. **Main Opportunity Loop** - Evaluates and places orders (every 100ms)

## Trading Workflow

1. **Startup**: Cancel all existing Pacifica orders
2. **Wait**: Gather initial orderbook data (3s warmup)
3. **Evaluate**: Check both BUY and SELL opportunities every 100ms
4. **Calculate & Place**: Calculate Pacifica limit price from Hyperliquid hedge price with target profit margin (`profit_rate_bps`) embedded, place order if still profitable after rounding
5. **Monitor**: Track profit every 25ms, cancel if deviation >3 bps or age >60s
6. **Fill Detection**: 5-layer system detects when order fills
   - WebSocket fill detection (primary, real-time via account_order_updates)
   - WebSocket position detection (redundancy, real-time via account_positions)
   - REST API order polling (backup, 500ms)
   - Position monitor (ground truth, 500ms via REST)
   - Monitor safety check (pre-cancellation)
   - **Dual Cancellation**: Immediately cancel all orders via REST + WebSocket
7. **Hedge**: Execute market order on Hyperliquid (opposite direction)
8. **Wait**: 20-second delay for trades to propagate to exchange APIs
9. **Fetch**: Retrieve actual fill data from both exchanges with retry logic
10. **Calculate**: Compute actual profit using real fills and fees
11. **Complete**: Display comprehensive profit summary and exit

## Opportunity Calculation

**Buy Opportunity** (Buy on Pacifica, Sell on Hyperliquid):
```
price = (HL_bid * (1 - taker_fee)) / (1 + maker_fee + profit_rate)
```

**Sell Opportunity** (Sell on Pacifica, Buy on Hyperliquid):
```
price = (HL_ask * (1 + taker_fee)) / (1 - maker_fee - profit_rate)
```

Prices are rounded to tick_size (buy rounds down, sell rounds up).

## Examples & Testing

### Core Examples

Essential examples for understanding and testing the system:

```bash
# View Pacifica orderbook (WebSocket live stream)
cargo run --example pacifica_orderbook --release

# Test Pacifica orderbook REST API
cargo run --example pacifica_orderbook_rest_test --release

# Test fill detection WebSocket
cargo run --example fill_detection_test --release

# Test REST API fill detection
cargo run --example test_rest_fill_detection --release

# Test Hyperliquid market orders
cargo run --example hyperliquid_market_test --release

# View Hyperliquid orderbook
cargo run --example hyperliquid_orderbook --release

# Test Hyperliquid L2 snapshot
cargo run --example test_hl_l2_snapshot --release

# Calculate opportunities without trading
cargo run --example xemm_calculator --release
```

### Fill Detection Testing

Comprehensive test for the 5-layer fill detection system:

```bash
# Test all 5 fill detection methods with aggressive limit order
# Places order at 0.05% spread to ensure quick fill
# Verifies deduplication and position verification on both exchanges
cargo run --example test_aggressive_fill_detection --release
```

This test:
- Places an aggressive post-only limit order (5 bps spread)
- Monitors all 5 detection methods simultaneously:
  1. WebSocket order updates (primary)
  2. WebSocket position delta (redundancy)
  3. REST order polling (backup)
  4. REST position monitor (ground truth)
  5. Monitor pre-cancel check (defensive)
- Tracks which method detects first with timing analysis
- Shows cross-validation status for position-based detection
- Verifies only one hedge executes (deduplication works)
- Checks positions on both Pacifica and Hyperliquid after hedge
- Shows comprehensive detection method summary with timestamps

## Running on Linux/AWS VPS

The repository includes bash scripts for easy deployment on Linux systems (e.g., AWS VPS):

### Single Cycle (Background)

Run one complete arbitrage cycle in the background with nohup:

```bash
bash run_nohup.sh
```

This runs the bot in the background, logs output to `output.log`, and exits after one successful fill + hedge cycle.

### Continuous Loop (Multiple Cycles)

Run the bot continuously, restarting automatically after each cycle:

```bash
bash run_bot_loop_cargo.sh
```

This script:
- Runs the bot in an infinite loop
- Waits 20 seconds between cycles
- Automatically restarts after each successful fill + hedge
- Rebuilds on each run (picks up code changes)
- Shows colorized output with cycle numbers and timestamps
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop

### Stop All Bot Processes

Kill all running bot processes (single or loop mode):

```bash
bash kill_process.sh
```

This stops:
- The `xemm_rust` binary (if running)
- The `run_bot_loop_cargo.sh` script (if running in loop mode)
- Any `cargo` processes spawned by the loop

## Development Commands

```bash
# Check compilation
cargo check

# Build (debug)
cargo build

# Build (release/optimized)
cargo build --release

# Run main XEMM bot
cargo run
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run  # With debug logging

# Run tests
cargo test
cargo test --lib  # Library tests only
```

## Terminal Output

The bot features colorized terminal output for easy monitoring:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  BOT CYCLE COMPLETE!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Important Notes

- **Mainnet only**: Production system, uses real funds
- **Single-cycle**: Bot exits after one successful hedge
- **No position accumulation**: Always hedges immediately after fill
- **Graceful shutdown**: Ctrl+C cancels remaining orders before exit
- **Credentials**: Never commit `.env` file to version control
- **Testing**: Always test with small `order_notional_usd` first (e.g., 12.0)
- **Deployment**: Run on AWS Tokyo to have the best latency, latency is critical
